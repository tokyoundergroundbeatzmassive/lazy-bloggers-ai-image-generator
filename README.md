## Description

I made this WordPress Plugin just for fun. 

If you are too lazy to look for a featured image for your post, this one might be the solution for you.

**Key Features:**
* Generates images automatically when a post is published

* Or you can let AI read your post content to generate image prompt
* Additional style prompt for fine-tuning generated images
